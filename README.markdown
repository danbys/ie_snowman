# ie_snowman

Rails applies the snowman fix to get around a Internet Explorer (IE) bug [1][r1] [2][r2]
Yet, since the snowman fix clutters the url we only want to apply the fix for IE browsers. `ie_snowman` monkey patches Rails to only apply the fix when a IE browser is detected.

## Requirements

Supported versions are Rails 3 or later, tested versions are 3.0.9 and 3.1.0.rc4.

## Install

- Add `ie_snowman` to your gemfile

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "ie_snowman"
```
